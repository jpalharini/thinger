# Thinger
Script to convert a plain text list to a Things project

## How to use it?
Thinger will convert the following text into a project called "My Project" with to-dos "Task 1", "Task 2" and "Task 3". The last two to-dos have notes within them that will also be added.

```
proj My Project
- Task 1
  One note
  Two notes
- Task 2
  Some note
- Task 3
```

# Future work
- Add more projects in the same file
- Add to-dos outside of a project
- Add checklist items in to-dos

Feel free to suggest more in "Issues".
