# Thinger
Script to convert a plain text list to a Things project

## How to use it?
Thinger will convert the following text into a project called "My Project" with to-dos "Task 1", "Task 2" and "Task 3". The last two to-dos have notes within them that will also be added.

```
proj Jira Deployment
- Bot to reply in channel
  Prevent any interaction without ticket
  Include instructions to create ticket
- Description of issue
  Tip should be "add error log, when problem started, impact to your tasks"
```

# Future work
- Add more projects in the same file
- Add to-dos outside of a project
- Add checklist items in to-dos

Feel free to suggest more in "Issues".
